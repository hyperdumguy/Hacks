      Slender/Npc Detector

--]]
-- You are more than welcome to use this in a script to bully them, Just know that it detects only black spikey hair slenders and not yellow or brown ones but  worry not, its rare to find these freaks nowdays.

for i,v in pairs(game:GetService("Workspace"):GetDescendants()) do
    if v:FindFirstChild("BlackSidewardsSpikes") then
        print(v.Name .. " Is a Slender/Cnp")
        game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage"):WaitForChild("DefaultChatSystemChatEvents"):WaitForChild("SayMessageRequest"):FireServer(v.Name .. " Is a Slender/Cnp","All")
    end
end
